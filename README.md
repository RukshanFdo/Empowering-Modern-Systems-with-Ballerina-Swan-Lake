# Empowering-Modern-Systems-with-Ballerina-Swan-Lake
Participating in the session titled "Empowering Modern Systems with Microservices and AI-as-a-Service using Ballerina" at WSO2 was an enlightening experience. Led by industry experts Anjana Supun and Fathima Dilhasha, the session delved into the significance of modern architectures such as microservices and event-driven architecture (EDA). With a focus on Ballerina Swan Lake, a cloud-native programming language, we explored its role in simplifying the development of microservices and EDA applications. The practical use case demonstration showcased how Ballerina enables seamless integration of AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) APIs, empowering developers to create AI-powered applications efficiently. As a participant, I gained valuable insights into leveraging Ballerina's capabilities to build robust, scalable, and agile systems. This session not only expanded my understanding of modern architectures but also equipped me with practical knowledge to implement them effectively, making it a worthwhile addition to my GitHub repository.
